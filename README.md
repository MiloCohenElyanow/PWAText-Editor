## Description

- This is PWA (progressive web application), meaning it is packaged to be able to work offline and not connected to the web! AWESOME! In this case this is done using the webpack node module, they make it pretty easy to package web applications. Otherwise this is litteraly just a simple text editor with some extra styling, but when you click install me, this web app will download, package itself, and apear as a desktop application which I think it pretty cool.

## Tech Stack
